# Quiz-App

This Quiz app was initially created when practising OOP, and has now been updated to use an API to get questions and Tkinter for a user interface.

I used the open trivia database API : https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
I configured the API parameters in the program in order to be able to change the category and number of questions inside the program.

OOP principles were followed with all features including Tkinter for the UI
